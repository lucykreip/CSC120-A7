I decided to overload the sellCoffee method for the cafe, to account for the coffee snobs that come in and ask for their regular and drink straight black coffee :) I overloaded the cafe constructor as well, to make the Compass Cafe be the default when reffering to a cafe on campus. I overloaded the house constructor to be able to create a house under construction, by not providing the mid-construction unknowns, like if it had an elevator or dining room. I overloaded both the house moveIn and moveOut methods to allow for a whole quad room to move in and out at once, if they so desire.
